# Uber NYC Rides Data Analysis and Visualisation

### Description:
This python-based project aims to analyse the Uber NYC rides dataset to unconver patterns and insights about ride activiy across New York City. Using data cleaning, transformation, and visualisation techniques, the analysis provides insights into the temporal and spatial trends in ride demand. 

### Key Features:
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed raw data to remove duplicates and handle missing values
**Temporal Analysis:** Identified ride trends by hour, day, and month to unconver peak activity times
**Geospatial Analysis:** Created heatmaps to visualise high-demand locations using folium and geospatial data
**Interactive Visualisation:** Leveraged libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly for interactive and static visualisations

#### Python Technologies Used:
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium
